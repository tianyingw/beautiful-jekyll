I am a postdoc in the Department of Biostatistics at Columbia University. I work in **quantile regression**, **measurement error analysis**, **semi-parametric analysis** and **high dimensional statistics**. The applications of my research include genetic and genomic data analysis, integrative analysis of genetics and electronic health records data, and epidemiologic research.
