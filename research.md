### Research Interests:
- Semiparametric Analysis
- Quantile Regression
- Measurement Error
- High-dimensional Data Analysis

### Software:

- Maintained:

   - [DAP](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DAP/index.html) (Discriminant Analysis via Projection): The R package DAP provides tools for high-dimensional binary classification in the case of unequal covariance matrices. It implements the method from the following paper:
[Sparse quadratic classification rules via linear dimension reduction by Gaynanova and Wang (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04817).

  - [CCP](https://github.com/tianyingw/CCP) (Categorize a Continuous Predictor): The R package CCP provides tools for correcting the bias due to measurement error when the continuous risk predictor is categorized. The package includes logistic and linear regression, considering when external data are or are not provided. It implements the method from _categorizing a continuous predictor subject to measurement error_.
    (This package can be provided based on request.)

- Contributed:

  - [deconvolve](https://github.com/TimothyHyndman/deconvolve): The R package deconvolve provides tools for performing non-parametric deconvolution on measurement error problems. It contains functions for finding bandwidths, deconvolved densities and non-parametric regression estimates.
