   I work in **quantile regression**, **measurement error analysis**, **semi-parametric analysis** and **high dimensional statistics**. The applications of my research include genetic and genomic data analysis (e.g., GWAS, TWAS and sequencing analysis), integrative analysis of genetics and electronic health records data, and epidemiologic research. My career goal is to develop and promote robust statistical learning methods to advance the science of public health and medicine.
   
  In todayâ€™s era of large-scale data, I believe robust statistical learning methods are necessary and important to handle the data heteroscedasticity.  As a result, I focus on jointly analyzing different sources of data (for example, genetic data and electronic health records) and examining different quantiles or subgroups of the population (for example, people with different levels of continuous phenotypes/traits such as BMI). Combining different data sets leads to more powerful analysis, and examining different subgroups helps give us a more comprehensive view of the entire population, further contributing to more precise analysis of the genetic effect and supporting personalized precision medicine.
