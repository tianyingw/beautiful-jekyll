### Research Interests:
- Measurement Error
- Gene-environment Interactions
- High-dimensional Data Analysis
- Machine Learning

### Current Projects:

- Semiparametric Analysis of Complex Gene-Environment Interactions in Case-Control Studies


- A Flexible Semiparametric Model for Complex Gene-environment Interactions via Nonparametric Likelihood Estimation

### Software:
- Maintained:
   - [DAP](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DAP/index.html) (Discriminant Analysis via Projection): The R package DAP provides tools for high-dimensional binary classification in the case of unequal covariance matrices. It implements methods from the following paper:
[Sparse quadratic classification rules via linear dimension reduction by Gaynanova and Wang (2018+)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04817).

- Contributed:
  - [deconvolve](https://github.com/TimothyHyndman/deconvolve): The R package deconvolve provides tools for performing non-parametric deconvolution on measurement error problems. It contains functions for finding bandwidths, deconvolved densities and non-parametric regression estimates.
