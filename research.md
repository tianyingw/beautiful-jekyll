### Research Interests:
- Semiparametric Analysis
- Quantile Regression
- Measurement Error
- High-dimensional Data Analysis

I work in quantile regression, measurement error analysis, semi-parametric analysis and high dimensional statistics. My special focus is genetic and genomic data analysis, secondary analysis of electronic health data, and epidemiologic research. My career goal is to develop and promote robust statistical learning methods to advance the science of public health and medicine.

In this large-scale data era, robust statistical learning methods are necessary and important to handle the data heteroscedasticity.  Given this motivation, I focus more on data integration in terms of combining multiple data views and considering the entire distribution of the population. The former leads to more powerful inference tools, and the later helps us understand genetic associations in different subgroups of a population, further contributing to more precise analysis of the genetic effect and supporting personalized precision medicine. 

### My current projects:
- **Wang, T.**, Ionita-Laza, I., Wang, Z., Weng, C. and Wei, Y. (2019+) "Robust Integrated Quantile Rank Score Test for dynamic heterogeneous genetic effect in longitudinal electronic health records analysis". 

- **Wang, T.**, Ionita-Laza, I., Li, G., Weng, C. and Wei, Y. (2019+) "Robust Integrated Transcriptome-wide Association Analysis". 

- "A Deep Learning model for breast cancer risk prediction based on mammograms". (with Wei, Y., Terry MB. and Tehranifar, P.)

- "Genotype-by-environment interactions analysis for heterogeneous quantile genetic effects on phenotypic variability". (with Wei, Y. and Ionita-Laza, I.)

- "A Flexible Semiparametric Model for Complex Gene-environment Interactions via Nonparametric Likelihood Estimation". (with Liu, J., Ma Y. and Carroll, R. J.)
